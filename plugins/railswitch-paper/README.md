# RailSwitch

## How to use

### Setup

1. Place a sign in the block above a detector rail. **It must be reinforced on the same group as the detector rail.**
2. The first line must be `[destination]` (case insensitive)
3. The second, third and fourth lines can be destination names.
4. When a player passes over the detector rail, it will only activate and emit redstone if a player set their destination as any of the three on the sign.

### Usage

2. Go AFK
