#This config is meant to illustrate more advanced uses of HiddenOre features, including the
# full depth of the tool config and what it means, and how it works in combination with other
# drops and configs.
#
#This is not a valid configuration file and will cause errors if used directly.
# It is broken into sections, small chunks of valid configurations that individually
# would be usable as a config.
#
#If you have any questions don't hesitate to open an issue on the official github:
