Random-Spawn
============

Random Spawn plugin for Bukkit


Originaly by  Josvth

This plugin allows you to setup random spawning for players when joining or dieing including overriding the return 
to bed on death.

Sponsored by DevotedMC: 
 * Adding new types of spawning for new players.
 * New event NewPlayerSpawn for other plugins to cancel prospective new player spawning events ( prevent from spawning in an area for instance )
 * Command /rs addspawn to add named spawn points with a spawn radius and exclusion; spawn type determines how they are used.
