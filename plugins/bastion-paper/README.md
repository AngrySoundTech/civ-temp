Bastion
=======

A minecraft mod designed for use with /r/civcraft

To install:
  * Add Bastion.jar to the server /plugins directory
  * Confirm that Citadel is also installed
  * Launch the server or copy the default configuration file
  * Create a Mysql database and account for the plugin
  * Specify in the configuration file
  * Relaunch the server

There's only one permission that may need changed: Bastion.dev. It currently just controls the text from the info command.
