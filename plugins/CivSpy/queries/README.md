I've been working with CivSpy for over 9 months now, and I have collected a number of queries that I use to regularly keep track on performance and activity on my server, that might be useful to you, since the CivSpy-UI has made no progress.

# Queries make raw data better

CivSpy focuses on aggregate data, but this data is remarkably useful for just about any question you have. For instance, we've used it to identify alt-ban evaders equipping their alts, monitor dupe use, track plugin failures and more easily refund inventories in cases of glitching, validate economic indicators, identify high-activity regions, and more.

What will follow in these query files are examples of long term tracking data that can be produced. Consider these as templates, and alter to include the data you are interested in tracking or publishing. 

Easily make "high-score" billboards / tracking for your players, etc.


Most of all, have fun with it!
